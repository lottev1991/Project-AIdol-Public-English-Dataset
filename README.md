# Project AI❤dol Public English Dataset

Due to a severe lack of publicly available English SVS data sung by a female singer, I have decided to publish my own corpus.
This is a selection of the full dataset; only English songs have been included, and only the very best singing data has been selected.
Only the default Arpabet phonemes have been used for the labels.
The voice provider is not a native English speaker, however the pronunciation should be good enough.
She is also not a professional singer, however the singing should be of passable quality nonetheless.

**Total duration of data:** 1 hour and 45 minutes.
