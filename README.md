# Project AI❤dol Public English Dataset

Due to a severe lack of publicly available English SVS data sung by a female singer, I have decided to publish my own corpus.
This is a selection of the full dataset; only English songs have been included, and only the very best singing data has been selected.
The voice provider is not a native English speaker, however the pronunciation should be good enough.
She is also not a professional singer, however the singing should be of passable quality nonetheless.

This dataset uses ARPABET phonemes, including the extended phonemes `ax` (schwa), `dx` (tap) and `en` (syllabic `n`).
It also features the extra phonemes `EP` (exhale), `GS` (glottal stop) and `vf` (vocal fry/creaky voice).
(The ARPABET symbol `q` was not used for glottal stops, due to a conflict with Chinese phoneme systems that are based on pinyin.)

**Total duration of data:** 1 hour and 45 minutes.
